	<h4> Why should I use SharedSchool? </h4>
	<p> There are many key advantages to using the SharedSchool platform. In summary, if you want to generate revenue and/or save money for your institution, join SharedSchool today! </p>
	<h4> Who uses SharedSchool? </h4>
	<p> Educational institutions, namely primary and secondary schools, media centers and libraries currently use SharedSchool. Teachers and administrators are also a part of the SharedSchool network since they are affiliated with their own institution. In the near future, we will provide individual user accounts where anyone can use the SharedSchool platform. </p>
	<h4> What is the cost of a SharedSchool account? </h4>
	<p> Nothing! SharedSchool is free. </p>
	<h4> How does SharedSchool work? </h4>
	<p> SharedSchool uses novel matching algorithms to correctly identify and optimize the proper listings with requests based on time, availability, and location. Our distribution network will then supply the materials based on these matchings. </p>
	<h4> How can SharedSchool make and/or save me money? </h4>
	<p> Many institutions either have surplus materials or need materials. We can generate extra revenue for your school by listing surplus materials onto the SharedSchool platform and connecting them to other schools who need these items. The schools wanting these materials will receive them at a cheaper price because they are typically used and have the option to rent them. </p>
	<h4> Why is SharedSchool different from other surplus centers? </h4>
	<p> In general, we provide a lower cost and higher flexibility than our competitors. Currently there doesn’t exist a marketplace and shared economy where institutions can list and request specialized materials on the scale that we do. Additionally, we are working towards social good, aiming to provide institutions with essential materials at a cheaper cost, enabling other schools to gain extra revenue in the process. </p>
	<h4> If I have to rent something continually (every year for example), should I just buy it? </h4>
	<p> The beauty about the SharedSchool platform is that the ball is in your court. You can decide! We recommend that if you are not sure about how many materials you will need in the future, or if the material is prone to damage/breakage, then rent said material. </p>
	<h4> What different abilities do teacher, administrator, and institution accounts have? </h4>
	<p> An institution account is an “umbrella” account made so that administrators and teachers can be affiliated with an institution. Administrators handle the transactions (requests/listings) and teachers have the ability to make suggested requests and listings. All accounts have the ability to browse the requests and listings on the platform. </p>
	<h4> I’m a teacher and I’m not sure if I completely understand the process of how I can receive and/or list materials. Can you describe this process? </h4>
	<p> Once your institution has created their own institution-based account, you will be able to create a separate teacher account under your institution. After creating your account, you will be able to add suggested requests and listings to be verified by an appropriate administrator. If verified, the request/listing will be added onto the SharedSchool platform and then accordingly matched with another institution. That’s it! </p>
	<h4> What if no one wants the material that I’m listing on SharedSchool? </h4>
	<p> We will keep your material listed on the SharedSchool platform until you decide you want to take it off. Requests are dynamic and constantly change, so odds are that eventually you will be able to sell your material. </p>
	<h4> Why is it important to become a part of a shared economy? </h4>
	<p> Shared economy’s connect buyers and sellers by the means of sharing a good or service. Becoming a part of one makes it easier for you to receive these materials by increasing flexibility and lowering the cost. </p>
