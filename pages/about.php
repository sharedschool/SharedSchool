		SharedSchool is a software platform that allows institutions such as primary
		and secondary schools to buy, rent, and sell specialized educational materials.
		Our flexible network is beneficial towards any institution. Simply put, we generate
		revenue streams from your surplus materials and provide cheap materials that anyone
		can rent or buy. Paired with novel matching algorithms, we create a convenient and
		unique marketplace where all the work is done for you! All you have to do is list or request
		your desired materials. We are dedicated to connect schools who have surplus materials
		to schools needing materials, simultaneously forming a new shared economy.
